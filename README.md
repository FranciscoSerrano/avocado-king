## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to use sample data of Avocado prices over time for practice working in pandas and matplotlib.
Goals in this practice project are to find correlations of price to region and avocado type, (I.e. conventional, organic, etc) and how prices have changed over time.

## Todo Checklist

A helpful checklist to gauge how your README is coming on what I would like to finish:

- [x] Project Overview
- [ ] Add data visualization of price change over time for a region (ex. Orlando)
- [ ] Add data visualization of a normal distrobution (ex. average price)
- [ ] Reach conclusions about data and add a summary of what we've learned.
